# Print the trivial arm: three scales at which a do-nothing baseline decided what an image restoration comparison could conclude

Toy training records, per-crop fidelity tables for a released restoration model and two interpolations, inference manifests, a memory-ceiling skip census, figure code and manuscript source for a study showing that at three scales of one restoration project the untouched input or the cheapest interpolation determined what the comparison could conclude.

This repository has not been deposited in a public archive, so it has no persistent identifier yet. One will be recorded here when an archive exists.

## What is here

- `paper/tex/` — manuscript source. The abstract, the methods and the figure
  captions are separate files and each is self-contained.
- `paper/figs/` — the R code that draws every figure and emits every number the
  manuscript prints.
- `paper/evidence/` — the manifest binding each artifact to its SHA-256 digest.
- `data/` — the 20 artifacts the manifest names, at the bytes that
  were hashed.

## Not redistributed

The manuscript's evidence manifest binds one further artifact that this archive does not carry. No number in the manuscript is derived from that material; it is bound because the manuscript refers to the content, and held back for the reason below.

- The project's own working record of this direction. It is an internal narrative that names other directions, planning decisions and process labels, and no number in the manuscript comes from it. Everything it contributes to the manuscript is stated in the methods section and is separately bound in the recorded-state artifacts that are redistributed.

## Rebuild

```bash
bash build.sh
```

The build re-hashes every artifact before reading it and stops if any byte has
moved. Figures and printed numbers are regenerated from those bytes rather than
transcribed, so the manuscript cannot quietly disagree with its own data.

Requires `python3`, `Rscript` with `digest`, `ggplot2`, `jsonlite`, `patchwork`
and `systemfonts`, and a TeX distribution with `latexmk`.
